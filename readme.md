Java Unit Testing & User Management Service Tests 🚀

This document covers Java project testing, including examples of test writing and execution. It includes test scenarios for the User Management Service and general JUnit 5 testing practices.

🛠 User Management Service Tests

📌 Controller Tests

UserControllerTest
•	testGetAllUsers: Verifies that the API returns a list of users.
•	testGetUserById: Ensures the correct user is returned when fetching by ID.
•	testCreateUser: Confirms that a new user is successfully created.
•	testDeleteUser: Ensures that deleting a user results in a 204 No Content response.

📌 Service Tests

UserServiceTest
•	testGetAllUsers: Ensures all users are retrieved from the repository.
•	testGetUserById_UserExists: Confirms correct user retrieval when the user exists.
•	testGetUserById_UserNotFound: Checks that an exception is thrown when a user is not found.
•	testCreateUser: Verifies that a new user is successfully saved.
•	testDeleteUser: Ensures that user deletion is handled correctly.

📌 Integration Tests

UserIntegrationTest
•	testGetAllUsers: Ensures that users can be fetched after creation.
•	testGetUserById: Verifies the correct retrieval of a newly created user.
•	testCreateUser: Confirms successful user creation.
•	testDeleteUser: Ensures that a deleted user cannot be fetched again.

🛠 Test Environment & Tools
•	Testcontainers is used for PostgreSQL.
•	TestcontainersConfiguration initializes a PostgreSQL container for testing.
•	Spring Boot Test is used for integration testing.
•	MockMvc is applied for controller testing.
•	Mockito is used for service layer testing.
•	JUnit 5 serves as the primary testing framework.

🏗 Java Unit Testing Examples

This section provides various Java unit testing examples and methodologies.

📌 Project Structure

📂 az.ders
├── intro       → JUnit lifecycle methods
├── calculator  → Simple calculator with unit tests
├── fizzbuzz    → FizzBuzz problem with parameterized tests
├── tictac      → Tic-Tac-Toe game logic with unit tests

📌 JUnit Lifecycle (az.ders.intro)
•	@BeforeAll / @AfterAll: Runs once before/after all tests.
•	@BeforeEach / @AfterEach: Runs before/after each test.

📌 Calculator (az.ders.calculator)
•	Implements basic arithmetic operations (add, divide, multiply).
•	Uses @ParameterizedTest with CsvSource for testing.
•	Handles exceptions for division by zero.

📌 FizzBuzz (az.ders.fizzbuzz)
•	Implements the FizzBuzz problem:
•	Multiples of 3 → “Fizz”
•	Multiples of 5 → “Buzz”
•	Multiples of both → “FizzBuzz”
•	Uses @CsvFileSource for parameterized testing with different datasets.

📌 TicTacToe (az.ders.tictac)
•	Implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with:
•	Board validation
•	Win/draw detection
•	Turn management
•	Includes unit tests for:
•	Invalid moves
•	Player turns
•	Win conditions
